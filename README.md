# PS2Keyboard interface


# DESCRIPTION

A simple arduino library used to read a PS2Keyboard using the PS/2 protocol
Many modern PS2Keyboards still support the PS/2 protocol!
You can use it through usb by connecting D+ (the CLOCK pin) to an interrupt
pin and D- (the DATA pin) to any digital input pin.
(you also have to supply the PS2Keyboard ofcourse)
